## Database Creation

To construct our database, we used the [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) for our salary data. In addition, we pulled cost of living data from [Numbeo.com](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) to in include in our dataset. Finally, we used [Maps.ie](https://www.maps.ie/coordinates.html#:~:text=To%20find%20the%20exact%20GPS,marker%20to%20the%20precise%20position.) to get the lat and long coordinates for our tech hubs.

Once we had our data, we utilized a jupyter notebook to clean our data and export it as csv files to use in pgAdmin 4. We also created JSON files so team members could begin working with the data in javascript while our API was being constructed.
